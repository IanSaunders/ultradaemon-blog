### Preamble

Whilst I really enjoyed the relatively flat Arkansas Traveller 100, it had been a few years since I had run a more mountaineous 100 miler. Argulably the last time I had done a race with signinfact gain was Bear 100, all the way back in 2019, where I had taken nearly 34 hours to finish the race, if you curious you can read all about ["The Mud Bear" in my write up here](/bear-100).

Hood 100 also had a number of great benefits, IMt. Hood is in Oregon, which is a quick trip from the bay area & I'd never been to that state. Edward, who joined for CIM and Napa marathon, had to decided to attempt his frist 100 miler. After a brief discussion it was settled. Tickets, hotels, and flights booked! We were going to Mt. Hood.

### Training

As a percentile, my shorter distances, 5km, half and marathon have always been much higher than my 100 milers. To train for 100 milers, I've usually followed a marthon plan and thrown in a few more long runs in, for example a marthaon to 50kms. I've also historically not been the highest mileage runner. Building up to Arkansas Traveller, I was averaging around 70km/43 miles a weeks with a spike to around 100km/62 miles, and whilst a solid amount on mileage, certianly nothing super higher.

Whilst time is in reality a bit of vanity metric, I do enjoy the process of figuring out how to go faster. Unfouranteyl all the tools in my running chest were starting to run dry. After a lot of deliveration, I thought now would be benefical to have a coach. I wanted someone who was both a fast marathon runner, and a fast 100 miler, ideally 15 hours or less for the 100. 

After randomly looking back at my Yeti 100 race, I noticed that the winnner of that race, Patrick Reagean, was also a running coach. I dropped him a message, and tada I now had a coach.

After the Boston marathon blocked we began building. The program was very different from what I had done before. The main differences were:
1. More focus on total mileage
2. Less focus no speed work
3. Inclusion of power hikining 

#3 was the most interesting to me, I had never practiced power hiking before and we did a ton of climbing in the local trails and uphill treadmill. The technique was different from what I had done before, but over teh 10 week block I felt much nore efficient climbing up the hills.

### Before the race

With Oregon being on the same timezone, Edward and I flew in to portland airport on the Friday before the race. After grabbing some supplies we headed to the race center to get our bibs. Looking up at the ski slope we would climb was very exciting. The day was lovely and sunny, but not too warm. A superb day for running.

Afterwards we headed back to the town. grabbed some german food and then I did a quick shakeout run. Overall I felt really good, legs felt strong and I was excited to see how my I was able to tackle the 5,592m or 17,000 feet in elevation gain. My only issue was a bit of a sore throat. It was a scratch dull pain when I swallowed or ate anything. I found that sucking a lozenger help numb the pain, so I grabbed a bag of them to carry wth me on the race. Eating one 40 mins or so.

### Race Day
It was a very rough night sleep. Our hotel was very convinent, but had pretty thin walls, and our next door neighbours had chatted loudly and watched shows until late in the night. I woke up feeling very unrested, but what can you do? I drank a coffeem, got prepared for the race and headed to the start line.

As we got to the start line it was pretty chilly. Edward and I dicussed the cold weather as I was only wearing a running singlet. After a bit of deliberation I decided I would be fine to start without a jacket - would I freeze as we ascnede up the moutain?

#### Start to Robinhood (0 to 23.2 miles)
Aid Stations: Start (0), Umbrella (7.1), Bennett Pass (11.2), Gunsight (15.4), Robinhood (23.2)

5, 4, 3, 2, 1! And go! We were off. I had decided to run my own race, and not try follow anyone elses strategy. The race went out pretty hard. As I had opted to start without a headtorch and run to the dusk, I tried to keep a few people close-ish ahead of me to light the way. The first km or so was chilly, and I half thought I had made a mistake, but as the winding climb up to the ski lift began I quickly warmed up. Whilst it wasn't super steep a start, I straight away started power hiking. Ignoring people run past was a psychological challenge, even though I knew it didn't really matter. I reminded myself that many of them were breathing hard, and I was keeping this as a nice steady effort. As we reach the top of the climb, I had re-overtaken many of those and felt like I had spent very little energy, hurrah!

A quick descent down to Umbrella where I re-grabbed some gels, and refueld my energy drink. I felt great and was really enjoying the beautiful scenery.

The run down to Bennett Pass was pretty uneventful, I was enjoying the easy flowing trails and lovely views. I was wondering how Edward was getting on, and hoped he had got through the climb well and was now enjoying the descent. After a lovely long descent and a brief climb up some road,  I hit Bennett Pass just under 2 hours. The day was starting to get a bit warmer, and made sure I topped up my water before the next section. As I left Bennett Pass, we began winding up a long fire-road, over a few rocky sections. One new strategy I was using for this race was to increae the elecolytes I took. I had mentioned to Patrick that I didn't feel I could retain much water later on in the race, and it just went right through me. He explained that I needed more electoyltes to keep the water down. I had noticed that I was needing the loo a bit more, so doubled down on my salt tablets. After making this adjustment, within an hour I noticed I was retaining much more water.

I grabbed some more water from Gunsight and kept of pushing. After the climb, the descent down was very enjoyable with some lovely scenery. I had made 1 effort, and not taken enough fels with me for this section. I had slightly miscalaulted and this meant I had a 40 minute block with no nutrition before hitting the Robinhood aid station. 

I was starting to feel a bit low on energy, so was thankful to have arrived, and I topped up on gels. I also had a drop bag at this aid-station, and the original plan was to change into different clothes to avoid being too exposed to the sun. So far the course had had a lot of tree cover, but I expected this to go away. Whilst I was doing this, an aid station volunteer came up to help. He mentioned that he had run the previous year, I asked him about tree cover, and he said was good. So last minute I made the executive decision to not change. I also had ice stored in a flask in my drop bag, so I fulled up a small ice-bandana which was delightful and headed out!

#### Robinhood to Surveyors (23.2 to 70.1 miles)
Aid Stations: Robinhood (23.2), Polallie (32.5), Surveyors (37.4), Fifteenmile (46.9), Underhill (55.1), Bottle Prairie (64.7), Surveyors (70.1)

Exiting Robinhood I walked and ate. I had packed a small tub of overnight oats to eat at they were delicious. I also decided to listen to a bit of music, this was something I never did during a 100 mile race, but this time I enjoyed listening to some tunes. Whilst flat, this part of the course had mixed amounts of runnabiltiy. Some sand underfoot made the path a little hard going. There was a fantastic river corssing where you could either walk across a thick tree trunk or wade the river. I decided to cross via the tree trunk. Edward later informed me he had gone the wading route! 

After the fun and games, the course settled down and I was able to enjoy pretty flowly trails. I tripped a few times on routes, which was annoying but overall made good pace. 

Some lead-forgging began as people had energy bursts or faded for a bit. As we approacehd the climb to the waterfall I was feeling the impact of low nutrition an hour or so earlier. My energy levels-felt low, though I was being consistent with the nutrition and hoped I would come back. The climb up to the waterfalls was much more clambering over rocks than I expected, but the number of walkers/hikers was far fewer than I had expected. Everyone was very courteous, and I made my way up to the top before turning around and heading back down down. 


Arriving at Surveyors for the first I felt, pretty good. I was able to snag some ice for my bandanan. Ate some food, and headed out. The day had become pretty warm, though the tree cover was good. Little did I know, that was about to change.

After an hike and gradual climb out of Surveyors I was feeling great. I thought to myself, "I think this is going to be my best ever execut and ran 100-mile run" I was able to hit the calories well, liquid was going down and generally I felt great. Around me many people were starting to struggle with the heat, but my heat training & ice-bandana made this feel very comfortable. 

I hit Fifteenmile (TBC) aid station, and was feelling a bit rough. The section had started to get tough, I had seen a few folks vomiting on the side of the path and the tree cover had diminished. There was sadly no ice for my bandanan and all my ice had run out. As I left the aid station, one of the voluneers mentioned the next section is quite exposed - they were 100% right.

This next setion I really sturggled, there was a lot of climbing and the sun was constanly beating down on you. I had my trust Hoka Sun bucket hat on, which helped - but I could feel the hot heat. Whilst I had taken enough water, it was not enough to pour over my head and I felt myself getting very warm. Though I felt hot, my legs still felt good. And I grinded up the hills hard, often overtaking of gapping people using poles. All that training had paid off. Another few people vomitting, and as I crescented another climb. and hit the Underhill aid station! Phew. 

Whilst I had been very efficient at all my other aid stations, I decided to spend a bit more time here. Eat a bit of food to prepare for what would become the night quite soon. I also made a decision to change shoes. I had been running in the On Cloud Ultra Pro, which were great but not the most stable shoes. My ankles were hurting a bit, and I had a pair of Hoka Tecton X3's in my drop bag. A very kind volunteer helped me swapped shoes as my feet had swollen and getting into the Hokas proved to be a bit more of a challenge than I expected. I grabbed my 2 head-torches and backup battery and set off. Within 2 kms of the aid station my mind had two very distinct thoughts.

1. Why did the race require 2 head torches and a charging source! Seemed a bit overkill, that said - trust the RD!
2. OMG - Why did I change my shoes? That was a huge mistake.

There was something about the change in angle, the tightness but the Tectons felt terrible. Suddenly I felt a ton of aching in my legs, and felt my calf muscles working harder. I assumed that this was just due to the change in drop and would go away. Afterall I had run all 100 miles of Arkansas Traveller in the Tectons and had zero issues with them. Unless I walked all the way back to Underhill, I would have to stick with the Tectons as I didn't have access to change shoes again.

The sun had started to cool as I made my way through a camping ground, lots of cheers from the campers was great. Apart from the aches and pains, nutrition was still going down well and I overall felt pretty good. This setion was a bit of a grind, and I don't remembmer a huge amount other than desperately needing the toilet for a few hours and was SO thankful when I eventually was greeted by 2 sharks and C.J. on my return to the surveoys aid station. I briefly said hello before dashing over to the toilets!!!!

I was still feeling strong, and it was a great moral boost to see C.J. he helped me get ready for the next long-section which had a pretty good climb. He also offered me some extra warm clothes. I changed into my thicker t-shirt, but i was feeling warm and good and didn't feel a need to put any warm clothes on. I said, see you soon - let's get that sub-24 buckle and was on my way.

Fifteenmile -> small aid station
Underhill -> changed shoes
Bottle Prarie -> don't really remmeber
Surveyors 2 -> Where I saw CJ 

#### Surveyors to Finish (70.1 to 100 miles)
Aid Stations: Surveyors (70.1), High Prairie (77.9), Gunsight (85.2), Bennett Pass (89.4), Umbrella (93.5), Finish (100)

Night came on quite quckly after I left the aid statiom. In my mind this section was supposed to be pretty flat, but was more of a slow gradual climb with a few rolling hills. I was feeling a lttle nauseas, so starting skipping my nutrition. At most I skipped a single gel. I was taking one every 20 minutes previosuly, so this seemed reasonable but perhaps it was a bit more than I should have.

My legs continued to ache and I kept regretting my shoe change. This messed with me psycholigcally as well as physcally, and I had to keep telling myself that it didn't matter. By the time I reacehd the High Prairie I felt pretty miserble. 

I decided I needed a re-group, I still had tons of time to get a sub-24 hour finish, and just needed to get myself in-order. The aid station voluneers were fantastic. Providing my with some broth and potatoe soup to enjoy. They also had a warming tent, so I jumped inside and took a 15min micro nap. It was very cozy, and myself and another female runner - who we had run past a few times during the day - really didn't want to leave. After a lot of enouragement I decided to make a move. I now felt quite cold, but knew once I started running I would quickly warm up. I had not brough a warm fleece with me, which was an error - so I grabbed a space blanket as I left and wrapped it around my shoulders to help warm up. Off I went.

I started with a power walk to begin warming up, and then started to do a little jog. The wind was coming in very strong, I couldn't wait until I got into the shelter of trees. Sadly within a few momnents 2 majors issues arose. 

1. A strong gust of wind whipped in, and blew my space blankey away - I qiuckly ran after it, but the gusts were so strong it was gone in an instant.
2. My right calf muslce totally locked up and I couldn't take a step without terrible pain.

I had 20 miles to go. Fuck.

What would could I do? I thought about going back to the aid station and DNF'ing, but reminded myself of that cold hard night at Beat 100 and how I was able to survive. I told myself that the muscle pain would go away. and I would be able to run and warm up. I decided to push on.

Mile after mile I struggled through the searing pain. It was VERY slow going, and people started overtaking me enmase. I kept griding. I found that if I took steps with my left leg and dragged the right leg forward the pain was not too terrible. It was just slow and very tiring. I pushed and pushed, get to the forest leading up to Gunsight and it would be warmer.

As I hit the more forested area, my heart sank again. The whipping wind cut right through the trees. This was miserable, I was so cold and tired, and was running low on nutrition. From the heights of being my best race ever, all I could think about was some how getting to C.J. and calling it quits. Sitting on a log feeling sorry for myself, a head torch shone my way? "Are you okay?", the fellow runner shouted out. I mumbled back to the group of 3, "yes". "Not far to go, keep it up", they chriped back, as they pulled away I quickly spoke up, "Do you have a spare space blanket you could spare?", thank the heavens! They did. I was elated, and was so grateful for this gesture. This time I wrapped the space banket against my body, and put my shirt over to stop it blowing away. I breathed some hot air down, and my body felt much much warmer. I was still cold, but at least I felt a bit warmer. I kept pushing on and grinding. I just needed to get to CJ and this nighmare could be over.

It's a funny thing about forests. They are dark. Very very dark. The last time I had experiened this level of darkeness was at Rio Del Lago, very little moonlight gets in. how do I know this? Well, ladies and gentleman. For this first time ever, my head torch ran out of battery! I couldn't believe it, I must have put the head-toch on a more powerful setting than I realized, and burnt thorugh the power in no time at all - I'm not certain how I missed the usual Petzl flickering lights warning but thankfullly, after a bit of fumbling in the dark, I got my second head-torch out, and was on my way.

As I had run this section in reverse I had some idea how far I was, and when I knew I was only a km or 2 away. I shed a tear or three as I new I had at least got to C.J. and could DNF. At this point, I was doing 4 km or 2.6ish miles an hour. It had taken me nearly 5 hours to cover the 19 kms between these aid stations. Miserable.

I told C.J. I was thinking of DNF'ing and how cold I was. We agreed that I would have a brief 30 minute nap in his car and warm up and then decide. I instantly fell asleep. C.J.s alarm went off, and all I wanted to do was go back to sleep. 

We started chatting, and I broke downin tears saying that I couldn't face another 5 hours of this pain to grind it out. He reminded me of the 1 pacing rule I gave him, don't let me DNF and how if I didn't finish this either I would have to run another Western States qualified or skip the lottery for this year. After what seemed like an enternity of back and forth, we agreed to walk to the Aid Station, and if I felt okay - we would start the grind.

A friend of C.J. also running hte race had DNF'd earlerier, and now i was bestowed with some lovely warm clothes. It hurt. It was going to take a long time. It was not going to be pretty. But, with C.J there, warm clothes - for the first time in over 6 hours, I belived I could finish.

With only 18 kms / 11 miles to go, you would think that we easily cruised through the climbs, the descents but that was not the case. it was a VERY VERY slow grind. step-by-step earning that buckle. I felt sorry for C.J. as he had come out to pace, but was now having to do a very slow walk. But we kept going. 

3 hours later, we started to head cheers and claps. We had enteted the final section of the race. In a cruel twist, you circle the finish area, looking down onto the end. As you start to work your way towards it, suddenly you veer away making another climb. It was mentally rought. The course was also very very runnable. In another world I would be cruising along the trails, savouring the end. Instead I was in the struggle bus, fighitng for every step I took.

Just over 5 hours after picking up C.J. we got to the final leg. Every 100+ miler, incluing Moab 240, I've kept my tradition of a sprint finish. I thougth about it for a minute, I tried to engage my right leg. I walked it in.

### Post-Race

I was very torn after this race. This was my best training block, until everything went wrong I thought this was the best race I was ever going to have. I ended up making a good, bad table to highlight what had gone well. This was my 8th 100 mile race, perhaps I had become a little cocky. No matter how many times you have finished this is a distance you have to respect. You have to respect that things go wrong: Head torche stops working. It's much colder than expected. You have some sort of injury. or any opther myriad of problems that arise. It's part of the beauty of this sport, every race is a journey.

Sadly Edward didn't have the day he wanted, and DNF'd after X distance. Likewise he took a lot of positives away from the race, and will be back again to try get his first buckle in 2026!

So what's next? Well, after 10 years of trying, 9 lotteries, I finally had my name puller. Western States 100 in 2026! Lessssgo.
