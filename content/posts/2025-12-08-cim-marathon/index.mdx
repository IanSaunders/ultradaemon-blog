### Preamble

CIM was an interesting race for me. For 2024, I had set a few running goals for myself, one of which was to run sub-3 hours at the marathon distance. To achieve this, I had booked CIM as a last-chance race for the year. After narrowly missing sub-3 at the Napa Marathon in March by 10 seconds, I managed to accomplish this goal in July during the San Francisco Marathon, though only by 38 seconds. This meant I now had an unspoken goal on the table: to try for a PB in the marathon.

For context, prior to this year, my first and only sub-3 was a 2:50 at the Edinburgh Marathon in 2018. Given that I had never repeated that performance or even come close, that result had felt like a fluke. You may ask why I hadn’t set a PB as a goal for 2024. Running under 3 hours is a great achievement in and of itself. As most marathon runners would agree, 10 minutes is a significant chunk of time, and I was not at all confident I’d get back into that sort of shape. Now that sub-3 was in the bag, why not roll the dice?

### Training

If I’m honest, the training for this attempt started on January 1, 2024. In total, I stacked four training blocks this year:

- Marathon Block 1 (8 weeks) - Result: 3 hours and 10 seconds  
- Marathon Block 2 (18 weeks) - Result: 2 hours and 59 minutes  
- Ultra Marathon Block 3 (9 weeks) - Result: ~22 hours  
- Marathon Block 4: This Marathon Block!

If you’re curious about my other three blocks, feel free to check out the respective race reports!

Coming off the 100-mile race, I took two full weeks to recover and then had seven weeks until race day. Hitting the ground running, I quickly started working on higher intensity but with slightly reduced mileage. I peaked at 90 km/56 miles a week, whereas during the 100-mile block I had peaked around 116 km/72 miles. Crucially, I was able to hit all my core weekly workouts: (1) Tempo run, (2) Speed session, and (3) Long run with marathon pace segments. Big shout-out to the Byxbee Parkrun and various running friends who made these runs much more enjoyable and held me accountable for hitting my splits—Dan, C.J., Boris, Mark, and Edward, among others—and thanks also to Bre for the regular virtual accountability push!

While there were seven weeks until marathon day, practically speaking, the block ended up being only four weeks long. Why so short?

**Reason 1: Berkeley Half Marathon**  
I hadn’t had a chance to race a road half marathon in 2024, and with training going so well, I decided at the last minute that it would be a shame not to enter a half marathon and try for a PB. The race went fantastically well, and I managed a 1:18:29, which I was very pleased with, beating my previous six-year-old PB by two minutes. That said, I hadn’t held back during the race, and with the course having a decent amount of elevation, I felt the fatigue in my legs. The following week, I decided to reduce both mileage and intensity, managing 60 km/37 miles of easy running.

**Reason 2: Post-half Sickness**  
A couple of days after the half, I came down with a pretty bad flu/cold. I had to skip the local 5 km turkey trot, which I had hoped to use as a 5 km PB attempt. It took a full two weeks to recover. During that period, my throat was extremely painful, sleep was challenging, and unsurprisingly, I felt pretty bad!

Due to these two reasons, I ended up with three weeks of taper, with the sickness resulting in a perceived loss of fitness after the Berkeley Half. As race day loomed, my heart said, “Go for your A goal,” but my mind told me it would be tough to hang on for the whole distance and that maybe I should be less aggressive. I waited until the day before the race to finally commit to going for sub-2:45 from the start.

### Before the race

Carb-loading has been quite the rage recently, and I’ve done my own experimenting with this aspect of running. I’ve settled on a slight variation from most of the advice I hear online. If you’re curious:

- Sunday to Thursday: Reduce total calories and try to avoid too many carbs—goal: lose some weight to offset the carb load  
- Friday: Hit the carbs hard—somewhere from 5 to 10 g of carbs per kg of body weight—goal: load the carbs  
- Saturday: Lighten up the carbs—eat to hunger—goal: don’t feel bloated on race day

This strategy came from my experience eating 10 g of carbs/kg for the two days before the 100-mile race, after which I felt quite bloated on race day. Personally, I prefer to feel a little lighter on race day for the mental benefit. It helps that I know I can ingest carbs pretty consistently during races, so I’m less worried about running out of fuel during these “shorter” races.

As with Napa, my friend Edward flew up from LA for the race. After a very quick race expo, we headed over to Folsom to meet up with another friend, Boris, to grab an early dinner. We all opted for a very adventurous chicken carbonara meal. I would love to say I had an early night, but as usual, I tossed and turned and fell asleep around 11:30 p.m.

### Race Day

Waking up at 3:30 a.m. sharp, I immediately consumed a Maurten 320 mix, one bagel with PB & Nutella, and a hot latte—delicious start to the day.

After a quick shower, I threw on my race clothes, filled another bottle of Maurten 320 mix for the race, and drove over to the collection/bus point.

I parked in the cinema parking lot, and we jumped on a bus. After 15 minutes of driving, our driver suddenly stopped and turned around to face the runners—he didn’t know which direction to go to reach the race start! Thankfully, a few people on the bus had their phones, and we managed to figure out the right route—momentary stress over. This was probably the only part of the day that felt a bit haphazard in the otherwise well-organized CIM event.

Our bus arrived at the start area a few minutes later, and I was impressed with the overall setup: plenty of porta-potties, very clear corrals, and good signage. Overall, super well organized. SF Marathon: please take notes on how to organize a race start!

The weather was perfect—no breeze and cold outside. In fact, it was so cold that my extra layers weren’t enough, so I hopped on another heated bus to warm up. Boris decided to come with me, while Edward headed to his own starting corral. A few minutes later, Boris also headed out to his start area. I decided to wait until 6:45 to make my way over to the sub-2:50 corral. I was hoping to see a few of my local running friends who were running around 3 hours, and just before we started, I heard my name being shouted out and managed to say hello to Mark (congrats on your great race). A moment later, we were off!

### Start to 21 km

And straight downhill we went! Having read a few race reports and drawing on my SF Marathon experience, I was extra careful not to go out too fast on either the uphills or downhills. In fact, my hill strategy was to exert an even effort: slightly slower on the ascents and slightly faster on the descents. I focused on maintaining an even effort around 4:00/km up and 3:50/km down, averaging around 3:55/km (roughly 6:26, 6:10, and 6:18 per mile). This was bang on my A goal pace. I felt good, but I knew there was a very long way to go. One downside of my pacing strategy was that because my pace pattern differed from most runners, I couldn’t really form or join a pack. Instead, I latched onto people with similar paces for short periods, often moving from one runner to the next as their pace changed.

My gel and aid station strategy hasn’t changed much since the SF Marathon. The only major difference is that I now use a mixture of Maurten, SIS Beta Fuel, and Precision Hydration gels. This may seem like a wild mix, but I find all the flavors acceptable. My main issue with gels is texture fatigue, so I rotate through these three brands, each with distinct textures, which helps me keep ingesting the calories.

The aid stations were well organized and frequent. My strategy was:  
1. Consume my Maurten 320 over the first 5 km  
2. Consume ½ a gel every 20 minutes or so  
3. Drink as little water as possible, ideally none  
4. Pour two cups of cold water over my head/back at every aid station

I followed step 2 loosely and varied my intake based on how I felt. When I felt good, I sometimes took a whole gel at once. I also tried to target caffeine gels at specific times: (1) 20 minutes before the start, (2) after 30 minutes, and (3) after 90 minutes.

Step 4 was new for this marathon. Over the year, I’ve found that I run hot, and inspired by ultrarunning (where using an ice bandana is common), I tried pouring water over myself during the Berkeley Half Marathon to stay cool. It worked very well. Though at one point, I poured three cups of water over my head and ended up with a brief brain freeze—gah!

The kilometers ticked by, and I felt reasonable during this section. I will note that the race features consistent minor climbs and descents in the first half. While CIM is a net-downhill course, the ups and downs even out, making it neither easier nor harder than a flat marathon, just with a bit more pacing complexity in the early miles.

### 21 km to the End

Having hit the halfway point at 1:23:15, I knew it would be challenging to speed up enough to hit my A goal, which required about a 1:22 negative split. Rather than fixate on pace, I focused on maintaining a steady, even tempo effort. This resulted in a small drop in pace to around 4:00/km (about 6:29/mile), with some variation depending on the minor ascents and descents remaining.

Since most of the elevation changes were behind me, I could maintain more consistent pacing, and this allowed me to run alongside a few other runners. I spent a lot of this period with a female runner who matched my pace strategy. I caught up with her at the finish to thank her for the help! At some point, two young NAIA runners passed me, looking very strong. I tried to draft behind them for a bit to get some relief from the mild breeze, but eventually, they pulled away—though I vaguely remember passing them again toward the end.

As we neared the 30 km mark, the infamous bridge was upon us. Having read race reports, I expected a steep, punishing climb. In reality, it was relatively short and gentle. I slowed slightly to avoid overexertion, and then I was in the final stretch!

The last 5 km felt like a time vortex, with runners in various stages of struggle: some kicking too early, some walking, and some holding steady. I fell into that last category, just grinding it out. I wouldn’t say I was in a lot of pain, but I certainly didn’t feel comfortable—my legs felt on the verge of cramping. I gained motivation by both overtaking some runners and being overtaken by others. The crowd support was fantastic, and while I couldn’t spare the energy to verbally thank them, I did manage a small “rock on” hand gesture to show my appreciation. Shout-out to Will, who cheered me on at random points!

Earlier in the race, just past the halfway mark, I had mentally settled on finishing somewhere in the low 2:48s or high 2:47s, depending on how long the course measured on my watch and how early I could start my finishing kick. I assumed there’d be about 100–200 m of extra distance even with good tangents. As my watch hit 41 km, I started to increase the pace with a final kick well under 3:00/km. With a loud shout, I was done.

Woohoo, a new PB! 2 hours, 48 minutes, and 17 seconds—overall a 2-minute and 1-second improvement. Fantastic.

### Wrap, Reflections & What’s Next?

After stumbling over to my drop bag, I changed into warm, dry clothes and made my way back to the finish area to cheer on friends who were still running. The day was filled with amazing results—so great to see so many people achieving their goals.

I was starting to feel tired, so I caught the bus back to Folsom and, after some food with friends, headed home to San Francisco.

**What about my result?** While objectively my Berkeley Half Marathon result might have been stronger, I know from experience how hard it is to nail a great marathon. For this reason, I’m very proud of this outcome. A 12-minute reduction in marathon time over roughly eight months is nothing to sniff at!

**What makes CIM great?** This was my eighth marathon venue—Montreal, York, Edinburgh, London, San Francisco, Napa, LA, and Sacramento. The aspect that really stood out was the high concentration of runners around my pace. I never felt alone during the race, which made it much more enjoyable mentally. I’ve effectively run many marathons solo, which is much harder. If you want to run with a bunch of other runners at a decent clip, CIM is a great option!

**What’s next?** While I’m still trying to structure my 2025 calendar—I have some relatively ambitious goals, including 100-mile races and marathons—the only sure thing right now is the Boston Marathon. Until then, CIM you later!

P.S. One final challenge of 2024 to go!
