# Arkansas Traveller 100 Race Report

## Preamble

The idea of racing the Arkansas Traveller 100 had been simmering for years. Back in 2021, I was on the hunt for a 2022 Western States qualifier. Unfortunately, a cycling accident derailed those plans, sidelining me for months. A heartfelt thanks to WSER for allowing byes—sometimes life just happens! This unfinished business lingered, and I felt a burning desire for redemption. I wanted to finally tackle the race I had planned to conquer in 2022.

Exploring a new state is always a thrill, and Arkansas was no exception. Fun fact: Arkansas shares roughly the same land area as England but boasts only about 1/20th of its population. That's a vast expanse of open land waiting to be explored!

## Training

Reflecting on my training, it can be viewed in two ways: either I'd been preparing all year, with other races serving as milestones, or I can focus on the dedicated training block leading up to this race. I'll delve into the latter.

First and foremost, I've managed to stay injury-free this year—a feat I attribute to smarter training. Incorporating more easy runs, dialing back the intensity, and embracing a robust regimen of stretching and strength work made all the difference.

Two weeks after the San Francisco Marathon, I embarked on a new training block. My ambitious goal was to hit my highest weekly mileage ever. Previously, my peak was around 65 km, but I set my sights on reaching up to 100 miles (160 km). Realistically, with only nine weeks—including recovery and tapering—I knew it might be a stretch.

Besides ramping up the distance, I made two key changes from my usual marathon training: (1) reducing intensity to focus more on time and distance, and (2) introducing back-to-back long runs. I thoroughly enjoyed this phase, managing to peak at 116 km in a single week! The back-to-back long runs were particularly enlightening. On day one, I tackled a hot, flat run of marathon distance or more. Day two was all about elevation gain—typically around 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) over a half marathon.

I wrapped up the final training week by cutting back on distance and slightly increasing intensity, culminating with a relatively swift parkrun (18:20), easing into the first 2 km before ramping up the pace.

## Before the Race

Unlike my previous 100-mile endeavors, I thought it would be fun to have a pacer and crew join me. My friend Phil from the UK graciously volunteered. His presence was invaluable—not only is he an expert crew and pacer, but he also has significant ultra-running experience, having placed 10th at the Thames Path 100 a few years back.

We both planned to arrive in Little Rock on the Wednesday before the race. However, only one of us made it that day. Phil, beset by rotten luck, got stuck in Dallas due to a delayed inbound flight. My journey from San Francisco was smooth sailing, and I touched down bright and early.

After checking into our Airbnb, I went for a short shakeout run to keep my running streak alive and indulged in a mouthwatering burger from a local smash burger joint. That night, I enjoyed a great 10-hour sleep. The following morning, I embarked on a running tour along the Little Rock River and its picturesque bridges, culminating at a trendy coffee shop where I began my carbo-loading journey. Shortly after, Phil arrived, and we spent the day exploring more of the city together.

That day, I managed to consume around 700 grams of carbs, fueling up with:

1. A banana muffin
2. Avocado toast
3. A croissant
4. A donut
5. A pizza
6. A bagel
7. A chocolate chip muffin
8. Orange and pineapple juice

By the end, I felt absolutely stuffed and knew replicating this intake the next day would be a tall order.

On Friday, we packed up and headed to the race start location. I wanted to scout the "technical" portions of the trail to gauge their difficulty and decide between trail or road shoes. This reconnaissance was invaluable—I immediately knew that trail shoes were the way to go.

We then drove to Morrilton, grabbed a pizza, and I was in bed by 5 p.m. Though, truth be told, I didn't drift off until around 9—pre-race nerves are no joke.

Waking up at 3 a.m., I enjoyed a bagel and orange juice before changing into my race kit. Given the frequemcy of aid stations, I opted to forgo the ultra vest in favor of a waist belt (Naked Belt), which had served me well during training as long as I didn't overload it.

We hopped in the car and made our way to the race check-in and start. We arrived just in the nick of time, quickly sorted ourselves out, and got to the starting line. In hindsight, budgeting an extra 10 minutes would have been wise... and then, we were off.

## The Race

### Start to Crew Spot 1

With an ambitious goal of a top-10 finish and aware of the hot forecast, I decided to start relatively quickly to bank some time. The race begins with a delightful downhill on paved roads. However, I wasn't prepared for the blistering pace set by others. Despite cruising at a brisk 4:30 min/km, I was being overtaken left and right. I kept reminding myself to stick to my plan, resisting the urge to get swept up in the excitement or doubt my pacing strategy.

Soon, we veered left onto the first stretch of hard-packed dirt access road. I began using my heart rate to gauge effort over pace, aiming to keep it around 139 beats per minute. I chatted with a few friendly locals as they passed me, gleaning tips about the course. One memorable encounter was with Cliff, a seasoned runner making his third appearance here, aiming for a bold 19-hour finish. Our conversation about poisonous snakes on the course stuck with me, more on that later!

After a modest climb, I felt the urge to stretch my legs and picked up the pace on the downhill. A few minutes in, I realized I was pushing too hard and introduced my first mantra of the day: "Take the free miles." It served as a gentle reminder to embrace the downhills without expending unnecessary energy.

Soon after, I found myself running alongside a shirtless runner who looked familiar. A brief chat revealed he was a lawyer from Arkansas, and I quickly deduced I was in the company of Wesley, the current course record holder. We shared a pleasant conversation before I pulled ahead as he stopped for water. Not long after, both he and the leading lady overtook me. Deciding to let them set the pace, I followed them into the first crew aid station.

After a swift pit stop, Phil expertly got me back on the course in no time. Crucially, I picked up a fully loaded ice bandana. At the moment, it seemed like overkill, I appeared to be the only one leaving with ice. but it would prove to be one of the day's best decisions.

### Phase 2: To Crew Point 2

Venturing out of the aid station, I found myself alone; the group I'd been running with had surged ahead. Feeling strong, I chose to be more conservative on the uphill stretches. The temperature was rising rapidly, and it wasn't even 9 a.m.

This marked the beginning of the out-and-back portion of the race; we wouldn't be retracing the initial loop on the Ouachita Trail. The path wasn't overly technical, but I was grateful for my choice of trail shoes. The miles flowed smoothly, and I ran solo to the next aid station, where I quickly replenished my ice and pressed on.

Shortly after, some of the early speedsters began to fade, and Cliff caught up, overtaking me once more. He looked strong and offered encouraging words as he pulled ahead.

The stretch between the next two aid stations was brief, and I made good time on the relatively straightforward trail. It felt invigorating to be ticking off miles efficiently. At the aid station, I was feeling fantastic, quickly refilling my ice bandana, grabbing snacks, and downing some ice water and Coke before setting off again.

About a kilometer later, a sinking realization hit me: in my eagerness, I'd forgotten to refill my water bottles. With approximately 10 km to the next aid station and only 150 ml of water on me, I faced a dilemma. Briefly considering turning back, I decided against retracing my steps. Feeling strong and relatively hydrated, I took a calculated risk to forge ahead.

As I navigated the trail. which grew increasingly technical but was predominantly downhill, I felt confident. To maintain my energy levels, I consumed a caffeine gel with the little water I had left. It provided a significant boost, and I made excellent progress. To mitigate the water shortage, I began sipping the meltwater from my ice bandana, it was surprisingly refreshing. As the last of the ice melted, I recalled a podcast with Tom Evans suggesting that swallowing ice can help cool the body. I attempted to ingest some ice shards, but my body protested. Instead, I continued drinking the meltwater and dampening my forehead. The heat was intense; each gust of wind felt like a wave of warmth. Upon reaching the next aid station, I eagerly refilled my water, drank some Coke, grabbed snacks, and moved on.

The next section began with a grassy area, heightening my vigilance for snakes after my earlier conversation. Fortunately, it seemed too hot for them to be active. It was here that I began to walk more of the hills. The relentless heat and exertion were taking their toll. Perhaps my reduced calorie intake during the last stretch was catching up with me, I'd been drinking Maurten 320, providing about 80 grams of carbs which I had missed out on. It was time for a new mantra: "Walking isn't free." I repeated this throughout the remainder of the race, reminding myself that walking is slower, still requires effort, and results in more time on my feet. This mental prompt helped counter the temptation to slow down.

I passed several runners struggling in the heat, overtaking them on both ascents and descents. I also noticed that once my ice bandana fully melted, I needed to lower my exertion to avoid overheating.

After 28 km of scorching terrain and a significant climb, I finally reached the second crew spot, aptly named Powerline. I was roughly halfway there!

### Powerline Out-and-Back

As I exited the aid station, I spotted Phil! He had navigated some gnarly roads to meet me and was ready to begin pacing for this approximately 34 km section. Settling into the back of the car, I shared updates about the previous segments while rehydrating and refueling. I was eager to let Phil set the pace and enjoy some conversation. After a slightly longer break, we set off.

The start of the Powerline section features a lovely, long, and runnable trail. We made excellent time, running the flats and downhills and power hiking the inclines. About 37 minutes in, we saw the first-place runner, Brendon, powering up a hill. He looked unstoppable, and we were impressed. Phil had noted that second place was only a couple of minutes behind at Powerline, so we mentally timed the gap, which had now stretched to about 40 minutes.

We continued pushing and arrived at the next aid station. After loading up on ice, we indulged in the best snack of the day: an amazing pumpkin chocolate cake. It was phenomenal.

Back on the trail, we maintained a strong pace. We saw the leading lady and then Cliff, both still going strong. Grinding along, we eventually reached the Turnaround aid station. The section had been hot and long. Instead of a quick turnaround, we took five minutes to enjoy some snacks and chat with the incredibly supportive aid station crew. Without wasting more time, we headed back out.

The return leg went smoothly and seemed to fly by, likely aided by the steady stream of runners heading the other way. Everyone exchanged friendly words of encouragement. Despite the tough going, we kept pushing. Near the end of this segment, I hit a bit of a low and could only muster a wave to passing runners—apologies for that!

As darkness began to settle, we returned to Powerline. Phil and I had planned for him to skip pacing the next section and instead meet me for the final 25 km. This simplified logistics and ensured I'd have support for the most challenging part—the end.

At the Powerline aid station for the second time, I couldn't help but admire those just starting the loop. It had taken us just under five hours to complete, bringing my total time to just over 14 hours. Assuming they maintained a similar pace, they'd be 19+ hours in by the time they returned, a grueling prospect.

Just as I was about to depart, we realized our head torches were in the wrong bags. After a brief moment of panic, we devised a plan: I'd take Phil's head torch, and he'd retrieve mine before the next pacing segment. Crisis averted.

### Phase 4: To Crew Station 4

Night had fallen, but the heat lingered. Climbing the first hill, I felt uncomfortably warm. It wasn't hot enough for an ice bandana, but the humidity was palpable. For the first time in any ultra, I decided to run shirtless. The difference was immediate, I felt significantly cooler. Embracing the relief, I focused on grinding out the miles, tackling a fair amount of climbing and descending.

All the aid stations were fantastic, but the Flamingo aid station stood out. It felt like stumbling upon a flamingo-themed nightclub in the middle of nowhere, how delightful. I took a few minutes to sit, sip some broth, and chat with the enthusiastic volunteers before pressing on. I knew that the infamous "Hell Road", a nickname I'd given it—awaited, a stretch notorious for its technical, rock-strewn terrain.

Just as I was about to leave, a fellow shirtless runner doubled over and vomited spectacularly. I quickly looked away to avoid a sympathetic reaction from my own stomach.

Soon after, the runner and his pacer caught up to me. We exchanged pleasantries, and he asked if I was enjoying myself. I candidly replied, "f#$k no, I just want to get this done." I began leapfrogging with various runners, many accompanied by pacers. At times, I'd latch onto a group for motivation. I found myself running alongside two brothers and their mom, who were making excellent time. We chatted about San Diego and other races we'd participated in.

Mid-conversation, a runner, presumably a course sweeper, passed us in the opposite direction, warning about a copperhead rattlesnake up ahead. Our senses heightened, we scrutinized every branch that resembled a snake. Eventually, I let them move ahead, choosing to tackle the remaining miles solo.

### Phase 5: To the Finish

Arriving at the aid station, I calculated that I'd covered about 144 km in roughly 18 and a half hours, or so I thought. Whether it was the heat affecting my GPS or poor tangent running, I soon realized there were still 26 km to go. It's always disheartening when your watch betrays you, but I steeled myself for the final stretch.

After some broth and chips, Phil and I set off. I mentioned the snake warning, but he seemed unfazed. In hindsight, perhaps he was preoccupied with the upcoming section. Not ten minutes later, he narrowly avoided stepping on a small copperhead coiled in the middle of the road,missing it by mere centimeters. A close call, indeed! Shortly after, he encountered his first tarantula. Quite the introduction to nighttime trail running in Arkansas!

This section was familiar to me, starting with an easy trail before transitioning into a rocky, technical climb. It was Phil's first real taste of the course's more challenging terrain, and he remarked on its difficulty, which I wholeheartedly echoed. We pressed on, summiting climbs and descending, striving to run as much as possible, though there was a fair share of "death marching."

By this point, I'd abandoned my top-10 aspirations and focused solely on finishing under 24 hours. With ample buffer time, it was challenging to muster the motivation to push harder than necessary. Our goal was to maintain a steady pace and secure that coveted colorful buckle.

Descending the final long hill, a wave of relief washed over me, I knew we were nearly there. Phil sprinted ahead to film my finish. Summoning a last burst of energy, I crossed the finish line. Hooray! Completing the race in 22 hours and 27 minutes marked my second-fastest 100-miler.

After a brief chat with the race director and proudly receiving my buckle, we headed back to the hotel for some well-deserved rest.

## Epilogue

Back at the hotel, we succumbed to the convenience of a McDonald's breakfast, though "terrible" might be an understatement. I took a quick shower before collapsing into a much needed nap. Upon waking, I contemplated returning to the race to cheer on the final finishers and attend the award ceremony. Unfortunately, time constraints and the need to return the rental car at Little Rock airport made it impractical.

Reflecting on the race and my objectives, I acknowledge that I fell short of my loftier goals. I had abandoned most of my time targets, aside from finishing under 24 hours, early on due to the heat. Did I give up on a top-10 finish too soon? Could I have pushed deeper into the pain cave earlier and harder? Did I not take enough risks in the later stages? It's hard to say. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed pushing myself, tackling more hills, and I'm extremely satisfied with the outcome.

Finally, I've always heard the term "California Carpet" to describe the smooth trails out west where I usually run. I never fully grasped why East Coasters used this expression, until now. I've learned firsthand: rocks, so many rocks.

## Side Note

To keep things interesting, I've been contemplating some long-term, multi-year goals. Inspired by Walter Hanloser, who has nearly completed 100 100-milers, and Ultra Kraut, I've decided to aim for running a 100-miler in every U.S. state. Having covered five states so far, I realize I need to pick up the pace!
