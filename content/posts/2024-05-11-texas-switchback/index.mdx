### Preamble

In 2023, I attempted to run the Quicksilver 100km with almost no training due to illness earlier in the year. Unsurprisingly, I DNF'd just under the 50 km mark. As soon as registration for the 2024 race opened, I signed up, eager for revenge. However, as you can tell from the title of this article, I did not get my revenge.

Shortly after signing up, I was invited to a wedding in Austin the Friday night before the race. After considering various logistical options, it became clear that there was no feasible way to return in time for the race start. So, I opted for the next best thing: finding an alternate race near Austin, the wedding location.

After some research, I settled on the Texas Switchback, which had several race options. Since this wasn't an "A" race or even a "B" race, the half marathon seemed the right distance and would double up as a marathon training run.

### Training

After running the Napa Marathon, I reduced my mileage and spent a few weeks simply enjoying running without the pressure of marathon training. I then began rebuilding my mileage up to 50 miles per week in preparation for my next marathon block, starting in mid-April. My goal: Redemption at the San Francisco Marathon, aiming to overcome my failed sub-3-hour attempt there a few years ago.

As I was mid-training block, I decided to taper lightly for this race, dropping 1 speed session during the week, and reducing mileage. 

### The Day Before

After catching an early flight from San Jose to Austin, I dashed around the city:

1. Grabbed a coffee and maintained my 131-day running streak.
2. Got a haircut.
3. Attended the wedding.

The wedding was fantastic, with great dancing, company, and food. I avoided overeating and drinking, heading back to the hotel by 11 p.m. With a 4:50 a.m. wake-up to make it to the race, I needed to get some sleep.

### The Race

After a quick check-in, we lined up at the start, and we were off.

I typically choose a target finish time for a race based on results from previous years. From my research, 90 minutes was often the winning time. Additionally, the course had historically been slightly short (by about 0.6 miles/1 km). Instead of aiming for a specific time, I decided to set a positional goal.

Rather than trying to hit specific splits, I aimed to stay just behind the person in the position I wanted to finish in, hoping to hold on and overtake them toward the end. In this case, I aimed for first place.

#### Motion 1: Single Track Mind

We started along a single track, which I hadn't accounted for, and I found myself in 6th place. The leader started moving ahead swiftly, and I worried that the gap would widen if the single track continued for too long. I quickly maneuvered around everyone, despite the tricky footing, and positioned myself just behind the leader.

A bike was leading the group, so I tucked in and let the lead runner set the pace. After about 2 km, the bike struggled up a rocky incline and was left behind. A kilometer later, the leader began to slow down. Rather than overtaking, I slowed down too, focusing on position. But then, the third and fourth runners overtook us, and I moved past the initial leader to sit behind the new leader.

#### Motion 2: Dry Throat Challenges

Unlike the initial leader, the new challenger picked up the pace and pushed fairly hard. I had decided to forgo water from the start, planning to pick some up at the first aid station. This proved to be a mistake, as it was warm and humid. My throat quickly felt dry, making the effort feel tougher than it should have.

I introduced myself to the leader, Phil, and we exchanged a few words while running. We both wore road shoes, which made the rocky sections challenging. I stumbled and fell on the rock ground at one point, and Phil kindly stopped to make sure I was okay.

At the first aid station, I quickly filled my water bottle and doused my head with water, feeling immediate relief. I was testing a new hydration technique with Maurten powder in my water bottle, which worked well with gels, though I couldn't pour it over my head!

Phil kept leading, and we arrived at the next aid station. We both refilled our water and started climbing a steep hill. Phil had been facing the wind and setting the pace, so I offered to take the lead and ease up the pace bit, pointing out that the third-place runner was far behind. I wanted to conserve energy for a later push. Phil agreed, and I took the lead.

I aimed for around 4:50 min/km but mistakenly looked at average lap pace (for the entire race so far) rather than the current pace. We were closer to 5 min/km, but that didn't matter since the third-place runner wasn't in sight, and we could focus on recovery.

#### Motion 3: Hammer Time

We encountered some nice flowing trails as well as some tricky rocky areas. I opted to walk through a few spots where I didn't trust my Vaporfly shoes to protect my ankles. Before the Aid Station I mentioned to Phil that I was originally planning to run 100 km today, a seed I planted in his mind to make him think I could do this all day long. At the third aid station, I could hear Phil breathing heavier, while a splash of cold ice water revived me. Although I had planned to push hard for the last 5 km, I felt the timing was right, so I accelerated around the 13 km point, going at around 4:10 min/km. This quickly opened up a gap between me and Phil.

After passing some off-road cyclists, I looked back and couldn't see Phil within 300 meters, further back was obscured by trees, so I decided to ease up and conserve energy, except on downhills where I'd push hard.

At 18 km, I picked up the pace again to ensure no one would catch up. I ran into a few half marathoners who were going the wrong way, likely due to missing a turn despite the course being well-marked. I hope they found their way back.

Cresting the final rocky hill, I looked back and saw no one in sight. I picked up the pace for the final 500 meters and won the race by 4 mins.

### Post-Race

Overall, I was very pleased with the result and my effort. I congratulated Phil on his well-earned second-place finish and we chatted briefly about our running goals. It was refreshing to focus on something other than splits, as running often becomes too time-oriented.

Now it's time to take a few days easy before gearing up for the San Francisco Marathon in about 11 weeks.

Oh, and I celebrated my win with some Texas BBQ at The Salt Lick. Wow, it was delicious!
