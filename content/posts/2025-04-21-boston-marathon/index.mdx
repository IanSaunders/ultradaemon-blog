### Preamble

Back in 2018, when I ran a 2:50 at the Edinburgh Marathon, I realized that my finishing time qualified me for the Boston Marathon. However, living in the UK at the time, I was more interested in the London Marathon, and the 2:50 earned me a 'good for age' entry, so decided to run that instead. Fast forward six years, and after running a sub-3 at the San Francisco Marathon, I was confident (being 10 minutes under the Boston Qualifying time) that I would make the cutoff. I signed up for Boston and received the congratulations email a few months later, exciting stuff!

### The Training Block

After taking December very easy with low running mileage, I ramped up quickly in January, hitting about 90–100 kilometers (50–60 miles) per week. Rather than focusing on marathon-specific training, I concentrated on 5km speed efforts, spending eight weeks doing 300m repeats and similar workouts. My long-term goal is a sub-2:40 marathon, and I knew that getting faster was crucial for achieving this goal. This training approach worked out well, I felt significantly more efficient at faster paces. I capped this block by running the San Francisco Half Marathon in a 1:17 high time, which included three very gusty kilometers along the Great Highway. I felt ready.

I then pivoted to marathon-specific training, and everything came together seamlessly. I hit nearly all my workouts injury free and felt stronger and faster than ever. Having heard about the notorious Newton hills in Boston, I added about 1,000m (3,000ft) of elevation gain weekly, primarily on local trails.

Three weeks before race day, I had my final big marathon-paced run: 32kms with 21km at 3:50 min/km. Could I get close to 2:40? Maybe...

Unfortunately, 11 days before the race, I stood up without realizing my left foot had fallen asleep. As I put weight on it, my foot gave way, causing me to fall and badly twist my ankle. Initially, I couldn't stand, and walking was extremely painful. For the next two days, I struggled to put weight on the ankle, wondering if my Boston dream was over. By day three, the swelling had reduced, and I managed a very slow 3km run, experiencing pain primarily when turning. Over the next week, I supplemented with stationary cycling and gradually built up mileage. After consulting a physical therapist, the verdict was cautiously optimistic but with some risk. I decided to take the chance. On Saturday morning, I boarded a flight from San Francisco to Boston.

### Race Day

I woke up early and quickly got dressed. Although the race started at 10 am, there were considerable logistical timings. First, I had to travel from Newton to Boston Common (6 am train), check my bag, and queue for the shuttle by 7:15 am, finally arriving around 8:30 am. I visited the Athletes' Village facilities a few times before heading into my corral.

I had mistakenly forgotten to update my qualifying time from the San Francisco Marathon (2:59) to my faster CIM result (2:48), which placed me in Wave 1, Corral 8. This oversight meant I'd likely encounter heavy traffic during the initial kilometers.

After the anthem and a plane flyover, we were off!

### 0 to Half-way

Ten minutes after the official clock started, I crossed the starting line. As expected, the initial kilometers were congested, making pacing tricky. Runners formed clusters on the flats and uphills, creating walls of people. I resisted weaving and waited patiently for gaps to open. The downhill sections allowed me to gain speed. The weather was relatively cool, but knowing it would warm up, I grabbed cups of water from the first aid station, pouring them over my head and back to manage my core body temperature.

The first half marathon flew by without any major issues, and I crossed in just over 1:23. I wasn't certain if I could maintain this pace but felt good enough to keep pushing, with ankle pain fortunately minimal.

### Half way until the top of Heartbreak Hill

After passing through the incredible and energy-boosting "Scream Tunnel" at Wellesley College, the hills began in earnest. Though the ascents and descents were mostly gradual, their cumulative effect was draining. I had vowed not to walk and maintained a steady effort. First hill—done. Second hill—done. Third hill—done. Finally, Heartbreak Hill—done.

### Heartbreak Hill to the Finish

Sadly, the hills had taken their toll. My ankle pain had increased, and while it didn't appear to effect my running directly it caused some mental fatigue. Picking up the pace felt laborious. Although the last 10km was mostly downhill, it included numerous small rolling sections disrupting my rhythm. Checking my watch frequently, I saw the sub-2:45 goal slip away. Could I still manage a personal best? I pushed harder, holding onto hope. Then the "2 miles to go" sign appeared, and I realized even the PR was unlikely.

A glimmer of hope remained. Perhaps, with a strong finish and not too much extra course length, sub-2:50 was achievable. Taking the famous "left turn onto Boylston Street", the finish was in sight. I pushed hard initially, but with a few hundred meters to go, exhaustion overwhelmed me. Glancing at my watch, I had around 30 seconds for the final 200 meters, time for a second kick! I sprinted as hard as possible, hitting speeds around 2:42 min/km (4:21 min/mile). I stumbled across the finish line, achieving my goal by a mere seven seconds. After previously missing sub-3 by 11 seconds at the Napa Marathon, I'd reclaimed a small victory.

### Wrap-Up & What's Next?

Sometimes life throws unexpected obstacles: injury, illness, or other misfortune. Thankfully, today I bounced back.

After four enjoyable months of marathon training, it's time to shift focus to the trails. Next up is the Hood 100 Miler in July, and for a change, I'll be working with a coach, [Patrick Reagan](https://patrickreaganrunning.com/).
