### Training
For the last year or so I had been hearing more and more about 200+ mile races, there are a number of great videos on YouTube/Vimeo which I had watched a number of times, and the experience certainly seemed to be at that next-level of ultra running experience over 100 miles. I was intrigued, but not yet willing to pull the trigger. Whilst back in the UK for Christmas I mentioned the idea to Sam. He said if I signed up, he would crew. That was the extra bit of motivation I needed, and I decided to pull the trigger over a new years catch-up beer with friends!

A month after Yeti 100 (September, 2020), I tried an FKT attempt in San Diego and tweaked my knee, due to this I decided to have a couple months of light running, after this period the knee pain subsided, and everything was back to normal. I setup a structured plan which incorporated 3 days a week of strength training and ramp up to about 60 miles (100km)/week of running.

I also had a couple more 2021 running goals (sub-5 mile and a sub-3 marathon in December). To achieve these goals I first focused on building a base, and then hit a mixture of speed sessions and long runs. Things were going very well and I was starting to feel the strongest I had ever felt, which felt great. 

Just as things the plan was coming together, bad luck struck. Whilst doing a 10km run with 1km fast-floats (5min/mile pace) I had had to last minute avoid an "obstacle" that stepped-into my path. I avoided the obstacle by stepping down onto the road, but as I did this, I tweaked my left calf muscle. At first I thought it was just a leg spasm, but that didn't feel correct. After standing around waiting for the pain to subside, I jumped on a scooter, went home and arranged to see a physical therapist. Unfortunately the injury was a strain of the soleus muscle, I would say between a grade 1 and 2. This happened on June 14th, which gave me around 4 months to recover and get back to fitness. Plenty of time right?

After taking a couple of weeks off, my calf felt a lot better and after a few light training sessions decided to push a bit harder. This was a mistake as I slightly re-inured the calf again. What an annoying injury this turned out to be! I took a few more weeks off, doubled-down on the strength work and started to lightly train again. Finally 2 months after the original injury, I started to up the weekly mileage, and managed a max week of 40 miles (64kms). Not exactly ideal for 200+ mile race, but with the base hopefully should be sufficient to get me to the end...


# Pre-Race

During the year I had been watching and reading race reports on this and similar races. I imagined that there may be some techniques that would prove useful in this race that I hadn't used before. Two in particular jumped out:

1. Running Poles
2. Taping Feet

I hadn't used running poles before, instead relying on the hands on knees technique. After a bunch of research I picked up a pair of Leki poles and begun learning to use them. At first I felt quite clumsy and they seemed to increase effort, but as I got better they
started to helped and I could feel I had lower heart-rate on hills with the same pace! 

I'd also heard a lot about taping feet, and Sam had his feet taped for Western states. I wasn't certain how useful it would be, but decided to train with taped feet to get used to the feeling. Sam had gifted me the "bible" of foot taping, and I read it cover-to-cover.

During the build up of months, I also captured a long list of every item I thought I may need on the run. When running 100  miles, I would forget 1 or 2 things, this didn't really matter on these shorter race, but part of running 200+ miles seemed to be risk-mitigation, so I kept a very organized list of items I wanted, how many I wanted, how many I owned and what I had packed! If you are curious about the list, here is a copy of that document!

# 2 Days before the race

I decided to fly up to Utah on Wednesday morning, 2 days in advance of the run, this allowed me to pick up any last minute items in Salt Lake City before driving down to Moab. The original plan was for Sam and a chap called Edward to come join me for race-day and crew duty,  but due to COVID travel rules this proved infeasible. As such, I would be running the race self-supported!

After the bad rain-forecast, I decided to upgrade my rain-jacket in a local REI before heading south, arriving in Moab around 6pm. I decided to a first pass at packing my drop-bags, but due to the complexity on moving drop bags and figuring out what should go where, I instead opted to sleep early and sort them out in the am with my remote crew!

I awoke after 8 hours feeling refreshed, and immediately begun sorting out drop bags. I had 3 key drop bags, which would move between 2 aid stations. These would have my sleeping bags, and other critical items such as spare battery packs in them. After phoning Sam to help work through the logistics, we finalized the bag contents, this took a surprisingly long time to figure out the right sequence of bags to ensure I had the right gear at the right time. Probably the 2 most critical drop bags were the ones at Shay Mountain (ETA night 2) and at Rd46 (ETA night 3), these were the locations where I expected it to be very cold, and most probably where I would take a sleep. In particular for Rd46 which would go over the highest/coldest part of the course, I wanted ensured I had a surfeit of layers to survive a potential night siege over the mountain!

After sorting out all my stuff, I popped over to a very efficient race check-in and then met my friend kit, who was also running the race and his wife and buddy who would be his support team for dinner. We met at a very American Diner, as I had had a very large Pizza for lunch I opted to just have a milk shake! Nervous chatter and then back to to the hotel for a lovely night sleep!

# Race

### Day 1 - Friday - <small>(0 to 71 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Hidden Valley, Amasa Back, Base Camp, (water), The Oasis, (water), Indian Creek

At 4:30 am I woke up after a horrendous night sleep, all-in, it was around 90 mins of sleep total - really not a great start, before most 100's, I actually get a pretty decent sleep, evidently the nerves got the better of me on this one. After liberally applying squirrels nut butter to my skin, and Chamoix cream to every seam of my clothes that I could find, I was ready to rock n roll. Kit's, Alla, and Greg picked me up at the hotel and we were off to the start. We got there well in-time to make sure we got our trackers, and then we wait until the famous destination trail mantra was shouted out, and we were off!

As expected with the dark start, I lost kit within the first few seconds, at this point I just kept to myself and focused on getting to the first aid station. The weather was cool and refreshing, and as the sun rose. The beautiful Mesas that encase the city of Moab. As the sun began to rise we ran along a lovely Mesa ridge-line and dropped into the first aid station, Hidden Valley.

The ascent out of Hidden Valley took us up a steep hill to the to of the Mesa we had been running along. There was a few minor drops of rain, but overall the weather was perfect. At this point I started chatting to fellow first time 200-miler runner, Jon. Soon after this we ran into 2 more keen runners, Scott and Lucja. After spending most of the morning by myself, it was great fun to have a few people to chat with. The world of ultra-running a pretty small, and I was recanted with interesting stories of Scotts recent run at Badwater, and Lucja adventure at Bigfoot. As we ran arrived at the Amasa Back Aid Station, I got to meet Lucja partner, Dion and his dog Gobi, from the book "Finding Gobi"! Talk about running with the starts :) Just as we hit the Aid Station, it began raining very hard and as I exited the Aid Station I was on my own again.

After a brief interlude by a precarious edge and a river, I began ascending another steep Mesa. By this time it was around 2pm, and I was having a bit of a low moments. This was in part due my brain doing a little math: 29kms done, and thus 351 kms to go - blimey, how is this possible?

As I crested the top of the Mesa, I was rewarded a stunning view of one of the horse-shoe river bend. The rock had become slick from the intermitent rain, and I was reminded of the risks when I came upon a runner with a hurt ankle, someone was attending to him so I carried on, I hope he managed to get over his injury and continue! As often happens with these long races, I suddenly came-upon my running friends and we continued our run together down the amazing Jacob's Ladder and arrived at Base Camp at 1pm after 7 hours, woohoo 33miles/52kms done!

As the next section had a long distane without aid, around one marathon, and also included a decent chuck of elevation gain, I made sure to head with Lucja and Scott to provide a little company. Before setting off, I quickly wolfed down a couple burgers, coke and a packet of crisps! Off we went.

Exiting the Aid Station, I felt good - the sun had not come out in too much force so far. Nutrition was going down well, and I was having a great time hearing all the amazing adventures that Scott and Lucja had been up to over the last few years. In particular Badwater and Oman by UTMB sounded like particulary challenging races! Half-way through this section we hit a water-only and topped up, before heading up into one of the most gorgeous Mesas, truly spectaciular views of Moab - real post card stuff!

Around 5pm or so, we all started to have our individual battles to fight. The poor nights sleep was starting to catch up with me, and I was feeling very out of sorts. Scott had some minor nurtirion issues, and Lucja - well she seemed fine! As such, our group slowly splintered apart as we each worked out way through physical and mental funk. I tried to keep Lucja in-sight, but this proved futile. I eventally caught up with Jon from earlier and we cahtted for a bit. Everyone was really feeling the grind of this long section and seeking the respite of the Oasis! As the sun sunk, I pushed myself along counting down every km!

7:37 hours after setting off from the previous aid station, I arrived at the The Oasis, 57.3 miles/91kms. I was feeling a bit miserable, so grabbed some soup, quasedilla and took a 5min laid down on a camping beds that were laid out. I saw Lucja and Jon sitting and chatting around the fire, but I wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone - so just kept to myself! After seeing a big group of people arriving, I decided to push on. The oasis wasn't a huge Aid Station, and I knew that the next one would have more things and I would take a longer break there. This decision turned out to be a mistake. As I left the Aid Station, I was tempted to ask how my friend Kit was doing, was he ahead/behind, but decided that I wasn't in the right mental state to know! Ironically, I would find out the answer in the not too distant future.

The trail our of The Oasis was very runnable, nice smooth track and slightly rolling hills. I tried to bounce back from my slightly slow end of the last section and was making decent pace. It was very dark and I was running all alone. It was at this point that I started to thinking something was stalking me in the bush. Perhaps some sort of wild animal? Every time I would stop and shine the light in the direction of the noise, it would stop and I couldn't see anything. This kept on for the next 30 mins or so. Eventually I gave up and made peace with it. Later I would realize it was my ultra vest rubbing with my shirt, oops.

I was feeling pretty horrendous at this point, I had a terrible headache, felt slightly dizzy and had had no energy. I foolishly did the maths, that when I would hit the Indian Creek Aid Station, I would have run only 71.3 miles/ 114 km, and would still have 168miles/266kms to go. I just couldn't do this. I had felt this bad in 100's, but I would only have 26miles/40kms to go. How could I do the rest of the distance.... I couldn't. I decided that it wasn't my day, and I should just throw in the towel at the next aid station. I told myself not to be an idiot, but all I could think about was going back to the hotel, have a long sleep and a shower. There wasn't one thing in particular wrong, but in aggregate I couldn't go on. I sat down, lay on the ground and turned off my head-torch as I was overtaken by yet another runner. I didn't really fancy talking to anyone at this point. As they overtook my, I noticed their very distinctive black bag. It was Kit! I was simultaneously glad he was moving well, but frustrated that I was struggling so badly and couldn't even bring myself to say hello to my friend!

I entered the Oasis Aid Station and followed the advice of many ultra runners. Don't quit straight away. I walked over to the food tent. Grabbed a hamburger and a coke. After eating, and taking a few mins rest, I still couldn't conceive over of going on. I walked over over to one of the volunteers at the Aid Station and said I didn't think I could go on. She was very friendly and we talked about it. She mentioned that as it was 1 am, and I didn't have crew, I would most probably have to wait until morning to get a ride out. I was 20 hours in, which made it around 1am, so a 6 hour wait. She suggested I sleep on it, and decide when I woke up. This made a lot of sense, so I grabbed my sleeping bag, hit the sleeping tent and closed my eyes - no alarm clock set!

### Day 2 - Saturday - <small>(71 to 121 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: The Island, Bridger Jack, Shay Mountain

7 hours later, I woke up feeling very refreshed and alive. A few things ached - but the fog over my mind had dissipated. I softly muttered to myself, "am I going to do this? HELL YES". I changed my shorts/socks, cleaned my feet, hit the toilet bucket, grabbed a pancake breakfast, looked at the tired souls just arriving at the aid station, thanked the aid station volunteer who had persuaded me not to DNF, and headed out into the wild!

As I walked out of the aid station I reflected on the night before. The closest I had previously felt to DNF'ing in a race was at Bear 100, but compared to last night that was just a passing thought. I learnt a few valuable lessons over the last few hours: Firstly, rest fixes many things. Secondly, I must run my own race - on reflection I probably pushed a bit hard on day 1 to stay with. Thirdly, I would finish this race no matter what. Finally, 240 miles is a long long way. A I swiftly ran/walked my way towards the road turning, I came upon a normal toilet - damn, I could have avoided the bucket, damn!

The run from Indian Creek to the Island was actually very enjoyable. It started off with a long downhill road section, which was very runnable, and then hit a trail section - which was very runnable too! This included running through a pretty dry wadi and some soft rolling hills. From a running perspective this was probably the most enjoyable section of the race. All in, I covered the 16 miles in just under 4 hours, I had really picked up the pace. This was evidenced by the number of people I was passing. 

At Indian Creek, I decided to risk having a hot-dog, which was prepared by a very kind daughter of one of the Aid Station crew, she insisted on finding me a large glass of coke. As the day was heating up a lot, I liberally applied sun-screen before heading out. The day had become very hot!

The next section to Bridger Jack was very gorgeous, running through a valley and then up along a ridge line. It was also very exposed with little shade. For this section I had opted to take and increase amount of water, 2.5L total, and I am glad I made that decision as the sun was very brutal. During this section I made a ran past a chatty group of folks. I said hello, but was keen to "make hay while the sun shines", so didn't chat for very long before pushing on. As the route began to ascend upwards the views became more and more amazing. I was still feeling pretty good, though the struggle was real. Though the route was in theory accessible via vehicle, I struggled to imagine how crazy one must be to drive along this road. The road had huge rocks, was very steep up and down and very little room for error. It felt very very remote. Low-and-behold I came upon a solitary 4x4, they stopped and let me run by with a waive. I'm not certain who was more mad taking this route!

The path up to Bridger Jack got steeper and steeper, and the chatty group caught up with me as they seemed to move very well on hills. I started to chat to Jackie and Walter. It was a super fun conversation and really helped to pass the time. A couple of fun things I learnt during that conversation, firstly Jackie, Walt and I had all run Yeti 100 in 2020, given the back-and-forth nature of that route, we would have inevitably said hello at some point! Secondly, Walt had the World Record for most 100 milers run in a year, 50 - what an amazing achievement! Walt and Jackie had a dictionary like knowledge of races in the US and suggested a few gems that I should run in the future.

As we pulled into Bridger Jack Aid station, we had officially covered over 100 miles! Only 140 more to go. This was my slowest 100 mile run in a total of 35 hours and 22 mins, but I would take it! We decide to spend a few minutes and Bridger Jack Aid station, Walt recommended the potato soup, which I tried and was excellent. Whilst I had taped up my heel and ball of my feet from the start, I hadn't taped my toes. This led to a pretty large blister on my left big toe, I had taped it at The Island, and decided to re-tape it at Bridger Jack. The medical staff and Jackie sorted my right out, before we headed out together. After running for a little bit together I decided I want to run a bit, so bid adieu to Jack and Walt and ran off towards Shay Mountain!

For those curious, my pacing chart had me arriving at 17:50 on Saturday, I arrived at around 19:41, so was slightly ahead of schedule even with the sleep. I predicted I would arrive at Shay Mountain around 2am on Sunday am.

I did some leap-frogging with a few folks for the next few miles which was a downhill descent, this was a reasonably enjoyable section, but I knew what would be coming - a very steep climb out up Shay Mountain. After crossing a dry sand river bed, the path became a narrow single track, a little foresty. I cracked open the poles, which proved very useful to help jump the numerous steams! I was starting to feel a bit tired again as it got dark, and as the path got steeper I had to take semi-regular breaks to lower the heart rate. Eventually Jackie and Walt caught-up and overtook me. I said I was very impressed with their hill technique, and Jackie mentioned keeping heart rate low/consistency. I took this to heart and tried to push a little less hard, and take less breaks. This seemed to work well, and I felt the overall pace was better. 

The destination trail team do an amazing job marking the course, given the distance they have to mark, I very rarely felt like I I needed to check the map on my phone to ensure I was on course. I also had the GPX files uploaded to my Garmin watch, though with a much lower fidelity. During this section was the one-time I went properly off-course during the race. I was making my way up a windy riverbed, and missed a right turn. The course got very very technical, and didn't feel right, but I kept pushing on. I eventually double checked the phone and found out I had gone slightly wrong. Thankfully the detour was only around 500m total, so nothing too horrendous. Finally I hit the the very steep part of the climb, the gradient went all the way up to 30%! I was very grateful I had my poles to help steady myself and stop slipping back! It was slow going, with many false horizons tops. I used the current elevation on my watch vs. what the GPX file said was the top to predict how far I was from the top, sadly this turned out to be inaccurate, and had to climb higher than predicted! After cresting the top, there was a reasonable downhill section with packed earth road, I began a decent bit of running before  re-ascending up to the aid station. Even though it was steep, it was much less technical than the previous ascent. As I arrived at Shay Mountain, I sat down in-front of the fire, ate a hamburger, a pack of noodles and asked for a spot in sleep tent, which the volunteers found for me. I closed my eyes, and tried to go to sleep. Unlike the first night I really struggled to fall asleep. This was due to a couple reasons. Firstly it was really really cold at the top of Shay Mountain, I had a good sleeping bag and I wore all the layers I could, but it was still freezing. Secondly, my legs were really painful - I think this was due to all the elevation gain over the last 9 hours getting to Shay. In retrospect, I should probably have taken an ibuprofen before sleeping, but I was trying to avoid taking any pills and save them for later in the race.

### Day 3 - Sunday - <small>(121 to 167 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Dry Valley, Wind Whistle, Rd46

I awoke around 5 hours after getting into bed, had some breakfast and got my kit sorted for the day ahead. I walked back over to where I had left my poles, and sadly they had vanished. The aid station crew looked around, but couldn't find them anywhere or any poles that had been left - which was surprising. So sadly I had to leave without them, I was frustrated with myself that I hadn't put the poles in my bag the night before, as I had read in other race reports about people erroneously picking up poles. I hoped that someone would notice their mistake and drop my poles off at one of the next aid stations, so I would have the poles for the La Salle Mountain range that night. 7 hours after arriving at Shay I was off to Dry Valley!

The start of the course was pretty chilly, but enjoyable with a nice running section along a road, this then turned right into a track. I had been avoiding listening to music but decided this was a good time to listen some tunes. I turned on a relaxing coffee podcast and then some rock songs! Good motivation, similar to the previous day I was able to make good time and overtook a bunch of people. Whilst this section wasn't quite as postcard scenic as the last 2 days, it had it's own beauty and was much more runnable! There was also a good covering of trees, so even though it was sunny, it never got too hot - though I quite rapidly removed my layers as I got going. This section proved pretty uneventful, and I was glad to hit Dry Valley around 1pm, perfect time for a spot of lunch, soup and an avocado toast! In the aid station tent was Jackie and Walt so had a little catchup. Turns out they had got into Shay slightly after me, this was surprising as I didn't remember passing them but it was very dark and I was quite focused on getting to Shay, Jackie mentioned she had been low on calories towards the end of that section and hence ended up slowing down. They had also left and hour earlier than me from Shay, weirdly they had seen my poles when the left! I checked at the aid station, no poles dropped off - sad times! Whilst chatting, I worked my way through my wildcard drop bag which had a few random items in it, this included a large array of first aid items. A day or so ago, I had developed a red rash on my feet and legs from what I think was a reaction to all the sand, so I applied a little Benadryl cream to try calm that down, it reduced the discomfort somewhat. I also decided that this was a good time to take a couple ibuprofen pills. About 45 mins after entering Dry Valley I headed back out. Seconds later, I realized I had forgotten one of my water bottles, so I walked back. I left again, and then realized I had forgotten nutrition for the next section, so I walked back again. I left _again_, I then realized I had forgotten my anti-chaffing cream, so headed back AGAIN. FINALLY, I left. Only to realise I had forgotten my hat. I guess I must be a bit tired? On the fourth attempt, I managed to leave the aid station!

After a few minutes I caught back up with Jackie and Walt, I had been trying to decide if I should sleep at Rd46, or push through until the end of the race and wanted to get their advice given they had both completed 200-mile races before. After a bit of discussion, they helped my make a decision that I would push through until the end. There were two factors that helped me make this decision, I had a reasonably large amount of sleep early in the race. There was also a cold and rainy weather front coming in. By my calculations, if I could finish by the very early hours of Tuesday morning, I would just miss this whereas if I slept I would have to endure potential snow and rain. I was very grateful for all their advice, wished them best of luck and pushed on. that would be the last time I would see them for the rest of my race.

The route to Wind Whistle was very runnable and I made good pace, in the far far distance you could see the mountain range we would need to cross, I didn't spend much time thinking about the huge distance still to go (100 miles at the start of this section) and arrived at the very beautiful Wind Whistle aid at 17:30, a little before sunset. The highlight of this aid station was running into the volunteer who had talked me into continuing all the way back at Indian Creek, she was delighted to see I was still going, and I was very thankful for her guidance! I did a little foot care and ate warm food at Wind Whistle as it was starting to get quite chilly. I made a minor mistake by eating the Mexican food at the aid station, it was rather spicy and after two bites I knew this was a bad idea. I quickly pivoted back to vegetable soup, but the spice played punch bag with my stomach for the next 4 hours or so.

Exiting Pole Canyon I started chatting to a chap called Tony Cline and his pacer. He had successfully run the Bear 100 race a few weeks prior, which I thought was wild and now taking on this challenge. He was in some pain, but pushing on - we had a fun chat before I pushed on, I'm glad to see he managed to push through and finish the race! The rest of this section was reasonably runnable, and not particularly note-worthy apart from a dead-snake I saw on the ground!

As I was rolling up to the Rd46 Aid Station, it was getting very cold and annoyingly I put my foot in some water and got wet socks. Joy.

### Day 3 to 4 - Sunday night / Monday Morning  - <small>(167 to 185 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Pole Canyon

It was now 10pm on Sunday night and I planned to push through until the end. On arriving at the Aid Station I quickly ordered a burger and some soup. I also got my Aid Station bag which had a bunch of extra warm gear for what was going to be the coldest part of the whole run. I sat by the fire, added layers and swapped out my cold socks. I was talking to a few pacers and a gentleman who had DNF'd around the fire any they heavily I suggested I team up with someone to run through the night. I asked the the aid station crew to let me know if someone was up for running together and a few minutes later they had someone ready to go! I quickly wolfed down the rest of my food and got ready. Due to the relatively dangerous nature of this next section this was one of the few full kit checks to ensure we had all the items necessary if anything were to go wrong and be able to hold up until help arrived, which could be many hours later!

A few minutes later I met up with Remo Spagnol, who I would be running with. Remo was a fascinating chap, who had a very impressive ultra running resume. He was also extremely efficient at power walking! As we started to ascend the rugged mountain I found myself struggling to keep up with Remo. I told him that I couldn't keep up and feel free to leave me and push on. The true gentleman that he is, he said he was willing to slow the pace down and work our way together. I was glad we had this conversation as I will admit I struggled a lot on this section. My biggest issue stemmed from having lost my poles and having to revert to hands on knees technique to get up the hills. This not only meant my effort was higher, but due to the strain my shoulder blades would sporadically have little spasms in them. I would lie down and have little trail naps/stretches to rest them, but the going was slow. The trail was also incredibly technical which meant a lot of mental effort had to be spent to pick ones path. After 67 hours since leaving Moab, this was the limits of my mental capacity. But onwards we went. Apart from the poles, I wish I had invested in the trail running torches that go around your waist, Remo had one and the amount of light these put out is stupendous! Upwards and upwards we went, colder and colder it got - with puddles of water now frozen, but we were getting done!

A few kms away from the aid station, I suddenly heard my name shouted out! I was a bit out of it, so I couldn't figure out who it was, amazingly it turned out to be Kit and his pacer Greg. They let us know we weren't far from the top, and then they pushed on! As we got to Pole Canyon at 5am on Monday, I was struggling quite a bit, and decided to take a 80s min relax session and let the sun come up before heading off. I thanked Remo for the great team work and chilled in-front of the fire until I knew it was now or never! Leaving the aid station around 7am, after stopping for that time, and having sat in front of a warm fire it was bloooody cold leaving the tent.

### Day 4 to 5 - Monday & Tuesday Morning - <small>(185 to 240 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Horse Creek, Porcupine Rim, Finish

The run from Pole Canyon to Horse Creek was broken into 2 main sections, firstly a little ascent and then a rapid descent to an unmanned water station, followed by a winding road climb into the Aid Station. Only one of these two was correct. 

The first section started well enough, after the long night section I was still struggling a bit with spasms in my shoulders but after making a few adjustments and moving more of the weight onto my chest the number of times the pain occurred diminished, I was also taking ibuprofen at a regular-ish interval (maybe once every 6ish hours?) which helped a ton. After the annoying steep rolling hills, I was excited to hit the nice long downhill 8km section. As we crested the hill and turned onto the the downhill I was presented with an EXTREMELY technical trail. Imagine running along an exposed river-bed full or rocks. The though of any decent running was blown, and instead was what felt like hours and hours or slowly picking my way through the rocks trying to avoid twisting an ankle. Once again I missed my poles. I ended up chatting to a runner and his pacer for quite some time, I think his name was Anders, which helped a bit in my misery! We eventually hit the bottom of this heinous section and started the windy ascent up to Horse Creek.

Arriving at Horse Creek the aid station felt amazing as I knew the end was relatively near and there would be a lot of downhill from now until the end. Though all the aid-stations were great, this one in-particular was very impressively run with a great dinning experience! I changed the tape on my feet, had a delicious burger and headed out for my final night on the trail. I chatted to a number of interesting folks, and was particularly impressive with the hill technique of a lady named Bri! I also happened to spot Ramo from earlier at the aid station, but he was having a great chat with ultra running legend Jeff Browning, so I didn't want to interrupt. 81 hours after starting, at 3pm on Monday, I headed towards my final aid station before the last section.

I will admit, I enjoy running more than I enjoy power-hiking and so for me, this section was one of the most enjoyable of the race. Most of the next 18 miles was gradual downhill on soft trails, I really tried to push hard and enjoy this section. I was met with a lovely sunset and views for miles. To this end, I knocked off the 18 miles at arrived at Porcupine Rim in just under 5 hours. Not bad for someone who had just run 200 miles! I had 18 miles, less than a half marathon to go!

When entering the Porcupine Rim aid station, I wanted to carry the current momentum and so, I took a page out of my 100 miler book. Instead of stopping for food, I refilled my water bottles, grabbed a pot noodle to go, and walked and ate. I felt really good and couldn't wait to get this race done! Hopefully all downhill from here... I hit this aid station at 8pm on Monday, 86 hours after starting!

The first part of this section was quite interesting, it was a nice gradual downhill but with a sandy road. The wind had picked up and this meant little wind gusts were throwing sand into my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, quite horrendous. I had read that this could be an issue in Moab, but this was the first time I had experienced it. I put my ear-phones in, put my transparent lenses into my glasses and used my buff to cover my mouth and nose. Though this work reasonably well it definitely made breathing harder, furthermore if you breathed too hard, you would just suck the fine-grained sand through the buff. I tried my best to keep the sand out my mouth, but this would be a challenge for the rest of the race. Even when the wind had died down, there were micro-particles every where. An interesting side effect was that it made me drink more water as my throat got dry from the sand.

After a decent downhill section we hit the porcupine ridge, which became a pretty annoying technical trail to run at night. Just enough rocks to make running difficulty. I pushed as much as I could, and fell into a zombie mode where all I thought about was pushing through to the end - literally telling myself push, push, push, push. Slowly the miles ticked away. The whole weekend I had got very little reception on my phone, and suddenly I had a bit of reception and got some messages from people. In particular I had a bunch of messages from Sam telling me to hurry up and get it done! For some reason this delivered a surge of adrenaline, and I was able to pick up the pace and get within striking distance.

As I started to come down the porcupine ridgeline I entered an amazingly fun bit of running and scrambling. It was a little bit technical, but this last section scrambling around rocks, dropping through a tunnel was really an amazing way to finish the trail section of the race. A final 5 km push along the bike path into Moab and I was done. 6am Friday to 2am Tuesday, 92 hours of effort. phew.

# Post-race

Almost as soon as I crossed the finish line the bad weather started to strike, I was glad to be finished by felt bad for any of the runners out there. It would be a very hard and cold night. I managed to get a lift back to my hotel from some very generous crew members of another runner. I tended to my wounds, ate some food, and feel into a glorious 5 hour sleep!

The next morning I popped over to visit Kit and crew to see how his race hard gone - he finished an hour and a half before me. It was interesting to hear the very different way the race had played out. We also hit a local Burrito place and did their humongous burrito challenge, the only food challenge I have actually been able to complete!

I then headed back to the race finish to watch Walt & Jackie finish, they were wet but happy! I also heard from other runners how the conditions had got pretty bad during the night, including the technical Porcupine Ridge trail getting covered in snow! I popped back again to watch the nail-biting finish where a couple of runners finished in the last minute, was a crazy thing to watch and so glad they managed to find that final bit of energy...

Finally, I made my way back to San Francisco on the Wednesday morning via driving back to Salt Lake City. For anyone who reads this, be very very cautious about driving back after these sort of races. I had 2-ish nights of sleep, but even then with the dropping adrenaline levels and general tiredness, I would never even consider doing a drive similar to that again, way too risky....
