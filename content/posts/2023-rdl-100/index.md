### Training
After finishing 2021 on an ultra-running high by defeating [Moab 240](/), I took a few weeks off to reset and think what 2022 would look like. Thoughts wandered to Badwater or similar notoriosuly challenging races, but in the end I settled on something a bit simpler for 2022 - [Arkansas Traveller 100](https://www.runarkansas.com/AT100.htm), a 50 miler and a marathon. As the new year rung in, I started ramping up the training.

Training was going well until a car decided to hit me while cycling downtown on an errand. Luckily nothing was broken though my left leg was in pretty bad shape. This resulted in an arduous 6 month period of rehabbing the leg, totally derailing my 2022 plans. As months went by and the physiotherapy progressed, perhaps my legs had recovered to a point where I could race again!

My first comeback attempt was at [Squamish 50M in 2022](https://squamish50.com/), this had a dual purpose (1) a fitness test and (2) pain test. Whilst I didn't make the final cutoff and landed my first _cutoff related_ DNF, there was the positive that my fitness was reasonble & I felt that I would have been able to complete the 50 miles - my DNF was mainly driven by running with my sister for the first 30ish miles, after she threw in the towel, I was able to speed up to try finish in time, though ultimately it was too close to pull it back. On a less positive note for 2 weeks after the race I had pain in the left leg. As I doubted my ability to finish injury free, I decided to DNS'ed Arkansas Traveller 100, which was a pretty sad end to 2022, no races completed. Fast forward to 2023 and around 6 months later, I ran [Quicksilver 100K](https://www.quicksilver-running.com/races). Sadly this time around, I was recovering from an unexpected illness 10 weeks prior to the race, but my legs still felt week. I knew I needed to change something. After working with a few local physios, I decided to virtually go back to my former physio, who is based out of London, UK - and setup a new plan. This involved much heavier weights and a mixture of new stretches. The new plan did the trick, and I was able to re-build, increase the weekly mileage with little to no pain.	

Other than being able to run pain free consistenly, highlights included: (a) a 73km week, (2) 110km in a 7 day rolling period & (3) a solo marathon distance run with ~1600m (~5200ft) in elevation gain. As training was going well, I decided to commit to a 100 Miler: [Rio Del Lago 100](http://www.rio100mile.com/).

There were 3 reasons I had chosen to run RDL, (1) It was a relatively local race, which meant less time, (2) I had heard it was an easier race, (3) It was a Western States Qualified - _only 2_ of these turned out to be correct.

# Pre-race

To set myself up for success, I wanted to make sure I was well rested. I took the Friday off work before the race, and drove up on the priori thursday evnein (to ensure the dirivn legs were not in t)
