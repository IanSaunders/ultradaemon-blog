### Training
After finishing 2021 on an ultra-running high by defeating [Moab 240](/), I took a few weeks off to reset and think what 2022 would look like. Thoughts wandered to Badwater or similar notoriosuly challenging races, but in the end I settled on something a bit simpler for 2022 - [Arkansas Traveller 100](https://www.runarkansas.com/AT100.htm), a 50 miler and a marathon. As the new year rung in, I started ramping up the training.

Training was going well until a car decided to hit me while cycling downtown on an errand. Luckily nothing was broken though my left leg was in pretty bad shape. This resulted in an arduous 6 month period of rehab, totally derailing my 2022 plans. As months went by and the physiotherapy progressed, I hoped my legs had recovered to a point where I could race again!

My first comeback attempt was at [Squamish 50M in 2022](https://squamish50.com/), this had a dual purpose of (1) a fitness test and (2) pain test. Whilst I didn't make the final cutoff and landed my first _cutoff related_ DNF, there was the positive that my fitness was reasonble & I felt that I would have been able to complete the 50 miles - my DNF was mainly driven by running with my sister for the first 30ish miles, and a
fter she threw in the towel, I was able to speed up to try finish in time, though ultimately it was too close to pull it back. On a less positive note for 2 weeks after the race I had pain in the left leg. As I doubted my ability to finish injury free, I decided to skip Arkansas Traveller 100, which was a pretty sad end to 2022, no ultra races completed, my first time in 5 years. 

Fast forward 6 months to 2023 and I ran [Quicksilver 100K](https://www.quicksilver-running.com/races). Sadly this time around, I was recovering from an unexpected illness 10 weeks prior to the race, my legs still felt weak. I knew I needed to change something. After working with a few local physios, I decided to virtually go back to my former physio, who is based out of London, UK - and setup a new plan. This involved much heavier weights and a mixture of new stretches. The new plan did the trick, and I was able to re-build, increase the weekly mileage with little to no pain.	

Other than being able to run pain free consistenly, highlights included: (a) a 73km week, (2) 110km in a 7 day rolling period & (3) a solo marathon distance run with ~1600m (~5200ft) in elevation gain. As training was going well, I decided to commit to a 100 Miler: [Rio Del Lago 100](http://www.rio100mile.com/).

There were 3 reasons I chose to run RDL, (1) It was a relatively local race, which meant less time travelling, (2) I had heard it was an easier race, (3) It was a Western States qualifier - _only 2_ of these turned out to be correct.

# Pre-race

Having struggled on day 1 of Moab 240 with so little sleep, I decided to be as well rested as I could for Rio.  The Thursday before the race I drove up to Folsom, CA, with the plan to spend most of Friday relaxing, arriving at my hotel I quickly fell asleep and had a very restful nap. Friday morning, I had a fantastic smoked salmon brunch at Karenâ€™s Bakery, and then went over to the race check-in & bib collection. This was very efficient, and suddenly I realized I had a bunch of free time with no plans, so for the first time since COVID, I went and I watched a movie at the cinema, the amusing Five Nights at Freddy's. I then headed over to the Beals Point Recreation Area car park to make sure I knew where I had to go early in the morning.

On my way back to the hotel, I grabbed a coffee to drink when I woke up in the morning and some emergency muffins to have during the race and batteries for head-torch. After back to the hotel, I quickly sorted out my drop bags and went to sleep. Waking up around 330am, I felt alright - I quickly wolfed down a croissant, my coffee, had a shower, changed and headed over to the race start! I was a bit worried about traffic, but in the end it all went smoothly and I was there a good 30mins before race start. As I did not have a crew, I left the car in the car-park and lined up ready to go!


## Race


### City Loop <small>(0 to 21 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Beals Point to Willow Creek then Black Miners Bar and finally back to Beals Point

And the race started! As noted in many other races reports, the start of the race is pretty flat with a bunch of downhill. I had decided to wear my Nike Next%s for this section of the race as I felt they would perhaps save me energy during this 34ish Km section. Given the regular aid stations, and coming back to the start I also decided to run without my ultra vest, saving a bit of weight. 

The mass start included both 100 mile and 50km runners, this made it a bit confusing to settle on a pace, everyone was going so fast! When we eventually hit the first hill, everyone just kept on running - wow, that was unexpected. Even though it felt a bit strange, I stuck to my principles and power-walked up the hills, only running the downs-and-flats.

Overall this large loop was pretty uneventful as we looped through Auburn predominantly whilst dark. The highlight for me was returning back to the Beale point, and seeing the large prison in the distance looming over the city. As I pulled back into the Aid station, my feet were a bit sore - not certain if my feet had grown since my last marathon, but the Nike's felt a bit tight. I swapped shoes over to the Asics Superblasts, grabbed my ultra vest - and quickly headed out. In some ways, leaving the road section made it feel like the race was _really_ starting, not to mention - it was warming up!


### Out along Folsom Lake & the American River <small>(21 to  45 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Beals Point to Granite Beach, Horseshoe Bar, Rattlesnake Bar and then Overlook

Exiting from Beales point, we got to cross over these very pretty roads, whilst they were not bridges, it felt like they gave an elevated view of the lake, given we were at end of the summer, the water was pretty low with quite a bit of open beach before the water. It was at this point that the leaders of the 50km race came sprinting back to the finish, impressive stuff! For the next few miles I had various fun chats with a few runners, many who were looking for their first 100 miler finish, I bid them good luck. We quickly arrived at the Granite Beach Aid station and it was starting to warm up! I had recently bought myself an [ice-bandana](https://ultimatedirection.com/ultra-ice-bandana/), and this was my first chance to try it out in-anger! The aid station folks were kind enough to give me a nice chunk of ice to throw in, and on I went.

The path began to be more single-track as we hit the worryingly named "Meat Grinder", whilst this section wasn't too difficult early in the race, I could imagine it being hard work on the reverse leg. The Superblasts also struggled with this section, and I was looking forward to getting to Horseshoe Bar where my trail shoes were waiting! It was a pretty long grind, eventually hitting Horseshoe bar, and shortly after Rattlesnake bar. The ice-bandana had done a great job, but I decided to eat some food, take 5 minutes to collect myself, change shoes to the Hoka Tecton X2s before heading out.

As always, big thanks to the great aid station staff. The grub was great, and really hit the mark.

Pulling out of Horseshoe Bar I had around 15 kms until the next major Aid Station, with a water-only stop before the big climbs. I ended up yo-yo'ing with a few runners, which was good for pace. One friendly chap suggested I take the lead as I was faster than he was, I was less sure of that but decided to bounce ahead while the going was good. Once again I had filled my bandana up with ice, which was very refreshing given it felt pretty damn hot in the mid-day sun.

There are a couple of things that are interesting about this part of RLD. (1) There is intermittent tree cover, which meant coming in and out of shade often. I hate wearing a hat when in the shade, so this meant a ton of taking the hat on and off. (2) It felt hotter than I think it was, I wondered if the sun was reflecting off the river and shinning up into the hills. Overall I can't complain was the weather could have been far worse. Onwards I pressed arriving feeling not too bad at the water-only stop (Mile 41).

The start of a long 5km climb began, I was surprised to see many runners jogging up this section! Once again I began power-walking the hill. I don't think the running folks were that much faster, and certainly seemed to be working pretty hard! This is probably a good point to briefly mention that running poles are not allowed at RDL. This rule surprised my at first, and whilst I don't know the race-directors rationale, the abundance of tight single-track would have made poles a bit hard (and potentially dangerous) to use. That said for this section they would have been lovely!

I chatted with a few other runners, and turns out we have both run with the world-famous Walter Handloser, it's easy to forget what a small world the ultra scence is at times.

Overlook SECTION

### Western States Loop <small>(45 to 77 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Overlook to No Hands Bridge, Auburn Lakes Trail, Cool Firestation, No Hands Bridge, and back to Overlook

b

### Back along the American River & Folsom Lake <small>(77 to 100 miles)</small>
#### Aid stations: Overlook to Rattlesnake Bar,  Horseshoe Bar, Granite Beach and Beals Point  (FIN!)
